What is the main advantage of using let and const over the older var keyword in JavaScript?

Correct Answer:
They introduce block scoping, making variable accessibility more predictable within {} blocks.
Explanation:

let and const are block-scoped, meaning they're only accessible within the {} they are defined in.
This avoids unexpected behavior caused by var, which is function-scoped and can leak outside blocks.
